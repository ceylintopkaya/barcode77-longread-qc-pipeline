# Overview

This project implements a **reproducible bioinformatics pipeline** for quality control (QC) of **Oxford Nanopore long-read sequencing data** (barcode77 sample).

The pipeline takes a **FASTQ file** as input and performs:

- Long-read specific QC using **NanoQC**
- Read-level statistics (GC content, read length, mean quality)
- Summary statistics with **Q10 / Q20 / Q30 thresholds** and coverage estimation
- Visualizations using **Python (Matplotlib / Seaborn)** and **R (ggplot2)**
- Excel reports and graphical summaries

The workflow is managed by **Snakemake** and runs in a **Conda environment** to ensure reproducibility.

# Key Features

✅ Multi-Sample Support — Process one or multiple FASTQ files with a single command  

✅ Automatic Sample Detection — Place files in `data/` folder and the pipeline detects them automatically  

✅ Sample-Specific Outputs — Each sample gets its own folder (`results/barcode77/`)  

✅ Ultra-Long Read Ready — Handles reads up to **686,155 bp**  

✅ Quality Thresholds — Q10, Q20, Q30 statistics for quality assessment  

✅ Coverage Estimation — Automatic coverage calculation (~16.8X for a 5 Mb genome)  

✅ Dual Visualization — Python (Matplotlib / Seaborn) + R (ggplot2)  

✅ Professional Reports — Excel report, summary tables, NanoQC HTML  

✅ Fully Reproducible — Conda environment + Snakemake workflow

# Key Findings

- An ultra-long read of **686,155 bp** was detected, which may help span repetitive genomic regions during genome assembly.
- The dataset produced **84.11 Mb** of sequencing data, corresponding to approximately **17X coverage** for a 5 Mb bacterial genome.
- **77.8% of reads are above Q10**, indicating most reads are suitable for downstream analysis.
- The **GC content (~53%)** matches the expected range for many bacterial genomes.

# Key Terms

**N50** — 50% of total bases are contained in reads longer than this value.  
**Q10** — 90% base-calling accuracy.  
**Q20** — 99% accuracy.  
**Q30** — 99.9% accuracy.  
**Coverage** — Average sequencing depth across the genome.

# Methods

- **NanoQC** — Long-read specific quality control  
- **Biopython / Pandas** — Read-level statistics  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** — Data visualization  
- **ggplot2** — Additional graphical summaries  
- **Snakemake** — Workflow automation  
- **Conda** — Reproducible environment management

# Recommendation

Based on the QC metrics, the barcode77 dataset appears suitable for downstream genomic analyses such as **reference-based alignment or genome assembly**.

The ultra-long read (~686 kb) may help improve assembly continuity by spanning large genomic regions.

Common long-read tools such as **minimap2** (alignment) or **Flye** (assembly) could be used for further analysis.
